# Answers to technical questions

## How long did you spend on the technical test?

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

Using AI based visual regression testing (e.g Applitools) is an area that would be interesting to explore further.

## How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
I have done this before and I believe the key point is to focus on the areas of testing that will bring the most value taking into account the cost/effort.
